title="Monthly Reconciliation"
text1="Accurate books start with monthly reconciliation. We carefully review all of your bank and credit card transactions, categorize them correctly, and make sure your accounts are balanced down to the penny. This process prevents errors from piling up and ensures that your records truly reflect your business activity. By staying on top of reconciliation each month, you'll always know where your money is going and avoid surprises at tax time."
text2="For small business owners, especially in the trades and service industries, monthly reconciliation is about more than just accuracy â€” it's about peace of mind. Instead of spending hours trying to track down missing transactions or fix mistakes, you'll know your books are always current and reliable. With Bear River Bookkeeping, you can feel confident that your finances are organized and ready whenever you or your CPA need them."
